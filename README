The loglite library is a simple header only C++ template library for logging in C++.
This library was written in a few hours to basically show that C++ has no real need for
bloated logging libraries like some existing Log4J clones out there as a result of the 
very usefull std::streambuf baseclass. While this library was meant only to demonstrate
the power of using std::streambuf, that makes it almost trivial to write your own logger
in a few hours. I took care to add some generics in order to make this library usable for
a more general public. Thread safety is optional and there is currently only a raw logger
for logging to syslog. Next to this, the library uses pthread mutexes. pthread and syslog
currently make this library POSIX only, so no MS-Windows portability (yet).
Please feel free to re-use the code in this library for building a more complete logging 
library.
