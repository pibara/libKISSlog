The loglite library is a simple header only C++ template library for logging in C++. This library was written in a few hours to basically show that C++ has no real need for bloated logging libraries like some existing Log4J clones out there as a result of the very usefull std::streambuf baseclass. While this library was meant only to demonstrate the power of using std::streambuf, that makes it almost trivial to write your own logger in a few hours. I took care to add some generics in order to make this library usable for a more general public. Thread safety is optional and there is currently only a raw logger for logging to syslog. Next to this, the library uses pthread mutexes. pthread and syslog currently make this library POSIX only, so no MS-Windows portability (yet).The design of the libraries should make it truvial to extend it with other log facilities and to solve the portability issues for MS-Windows. 
Unless I get masive positive input on this library, I won't spent much more time on it, given that it was meant as a demonstrator and I went to far already with the template infrastructure for making it just a demonstrator of std::streambuf usage. Please feel free to re-use the code in this library for building a more complete logging library.
