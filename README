The loglite library is a simple header only C++(11) template library for logging in C++. 

The first version of this library was written in a few hours to basically show that C++ has no real need for bloated logging libraries, like some existing Log4J clones out there , as a result of the very usefull std::streambuf baseclass. While this library was meant only to demonstrate the power of using std::streambuf. A construct that makes it almost trivial to write your own logger in a few hours, I took care to add some generics in order to make this library usable for a more general public. 
After some positive feedback about my logger I spent some more time in order to:

* Support both C++11 (on POSIX and Windows systems) and C++03 (on POSIX systems only).
* Next to syslog, also support a wrapped ostream for logging to.
* Some speed optimisation.

Thread safety is optional so you donh't pay the performance penalty of thread safe code on single threaded systems. There are currently only two raw loggers. One for logging to syslog (that isn't available when compiled for Windows), and one for logging to an ostream that basically just prepends the time before each line before sending it to the raw ostream it wraps.

The design of the libraries should make it trivial to extend it with other log facilities by writing your own simple raw logger template class.

Please note that this library has not actually been tested on MS-Windows, so I'm not sure if it actualy compiles on that platform. In any case it won't work on windows unless you have C++11 set as the standard your compiler should use. The library will soon change its name, given that loglite seems to already be taken.
